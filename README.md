# PROJECT NAME
Netclips
## Description

Duration to complete: 20-25 hours. 

This project is a simple movie view/add application. It heavily relies on Redux, Sagas, React, and a sql database with multiple tables which require "many-to-many" to join their data. 

In the future, I intend to add a form to add your own movies complete with pictures, details, and genres. I will also add a friendlier user interface to navigate to other pages within this app, as well as the ability to delete movies.

## Installation

The queries in the `tables.sql` file are set up to create all the necessary tables and populate the needed data to allow the application to run correctly. The project is built on [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/download/), so you will need to make sure to have that installed. We recommend using Postico to run those queries as that was used to create the queries, 
3. Open up your editor of choice and run an `npm install`
4. Run `npm run server` in your terminal
5. Run `npm run client` in your terminal
6. The `npm run client` command will open up a new browser tab for you!

## Usage
How does someone use this application? Tell a user story here.

1. On page load, you will see the full list of movies.
2. Move your mouse over one to select it(you'll see a red outline appear)
3. Click on it and it will take you to the details page for that movie
4. A button to return to the home page is at the bottom of the details page
5. Future construction will have an "add movie" form for independent categorization
